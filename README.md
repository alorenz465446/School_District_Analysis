# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of school district using Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries(Pandas & NumPy). I will be replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs and running a new clean analysis of the school district. 


## District Analysis Results:

* Schools with a higher spending ranges (per student) have the lowest passing percentages and averages for both areas of study (Math & Reading).

* Schools with a larger size have the lowest over all passing percentage. The passing math percentage is much lower than the medium and smaller sized schools too.

* Charter schools outperformed district schools in math scores, reading scores, and all percentages to include % Overall Passing. 



## School Analysis Summary:
The projected data was different after replacing the scores for Thomas High School and running the analysis again. Through the analysis this time you can see a fluctuation in the math scores and overall percentage. After the analysis was completed you can see that larger district schools had the lowest scores among the rest. Leading to believe that the root problem for the % Overall Passing being pulled down is because of larger district schools, specifically their math scores.
