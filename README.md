# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of school district using Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries(Pandas & NumPy). I will be replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs and running a new clean analysis of the school district. 


## District Analysis Results:

* Schools with a higher spending ranges (per student) had the lowest passing percentages and averages for both areas of study (Math & Reading)

* Schools with a larger size have the lowest over all passing percentage. The passing math percentage is much lower than the medium and smaller sized schools.

* Charter schools outperformed district schools in math scores, reading scores, and all percentages to include % Overall Passing. 



## School Analysis Summary:
The district passing math percentage is very low compared to all other percentages and is pulling down the % Overall passing. Leading to larger district schools to be the root cause of the huge drop in overall percentage.
