# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of school district using Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries(Pandas & NumPy). I will be replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs and running a new clean analysis of the school district. 


## District Analysis Results

Schools with a higher spending ranges (per student) had the lowest passing percentages and averages for both areas of study (Math & Reading)

Schools with a larger size have the lowest over all passing percentage. The passing math percentage is much lower than the medium and smaller sized schools.

Charter schools outperformed district schools in math scores, reading scores, and all percentages to include % Overall Passing. 


## School Analysis Summary 
The district passing math percentage is very low compared to all other percentages and is pulling down the % Overall passing. Leading to larger district schools to be the root cause of the huge drop in overall percentage.
